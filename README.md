# AI-Powered Financial Statement Analyzer

Understanding financial statements can be challenging, especially for non-finance 
professionals or students. This project provides a solution by allowing users to upload 
PDFs or Excel files containing balance sheets and other financial statements. The 
system uses AI to generate clear, plain-language summaries of the data. It highlights 
important trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and potential risks using simple 
explanations and visual charts. This makes financial insights accessible quickly, helping 
users make informed decisions without needing deep financial expertise.
